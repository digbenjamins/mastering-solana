## Wallets

This codebase uses demo wallets for educational purposes. **Do not transfer any real funds to these wallets**, as their private keys are publicly available in the repository. Anyone can regenerate these keypairs. If you need new wallets, update the private keys in the `src/wallet/id/` directory.
